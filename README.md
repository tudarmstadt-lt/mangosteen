This repository contains an implementation of a a system for inducing distributional sense-aware semantic classes labeled with hypernyms. The cleansed hypernymy relations extracted with the coarse model are [available online](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g8aCVm6SozuHyBmld-X69bDdek1gzBvQfu7wJJv1b8U/edit?usp=sharing). The result of the extraction is available in the directory ```data```, while the scripts are available in the directory ```code```.
