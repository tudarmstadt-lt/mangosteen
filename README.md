Mangosteen
---------

Mangosteen is a rare fruit. This repository contains an implementation of a a system for inducing distributional sense-aware semantic classes labeled with hypernyms. It helps to induced hypernyms of rare words, such as "mangosteen", which are often cannot be directly extracted from text, because such rare words do not appear in the required for extraction contexts. 

This repository contains databases of hypernyms cleansed and expanded with our method. The result of the extraction is available in the directory ```data```, while the scripts are available in the directory ```code```. The cleansed hypernymy relations extracted with the coarse model are [available online](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g8aCVm6SozuHyBmld-X69bDdek1gzBvQfu7wJJv1b8U/edit?usp=sharing).
